[drip]
	- sometimes crashes with small delays
	. according to the backtrace this should be a memory corruption
	. (actually the crashing bug was buggy by design and i haven't got a simple bug-patch yet)

[s2l]
	- numerically looking sub-symbols are converted wrongly to floats: e.g. "192.168.0.1" -> 192,168
